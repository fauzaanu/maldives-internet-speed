## Usage

This script is written in vanilla python only. (This script was written without any internet connection right after
changing homes. I just wanted to see a comparison)

To run this update the `data.csv` with the initial data from your sources and run `main.py` with python to
get `result.csv`
and `result_simple.csv`
